# Weather Dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard. The requirements include utilising the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/forecast5" target="_blank" alt = "open weather API">Open Weather API</a> to display the current weather conditions when searching for a city name. 

When a user searches for a city, the weather forecast (specifically the temperature, humidity and wind speed) for the current day as well as the next five days is displayed. Previous city searches are also saved in the side panel of the page. When the user clicks on a city that was previously clicked, the weather for the city reappears. I was also able to include icons aligned with the weather conditions.

## What Have I Learned
I will not be a front-end engineer. It’s official. I hate dealing with CSS/bootstrap/anything design related so much. I don’t want to look at any padding/margins/width etc. ever again. Although one of my mentors noticed how I am progressing with my JavaScript syntax which I am very proud of, even if it does not feel like it. I also learned more about converting the date (which I don't understand why it has to be in epoch format?). I also feel much better about how to read a full URL link. I left additional comments in the code with a few notes about what I learned while I was coding and in tutoring sessions. 

## Technologies Used
* CSS
* HTML
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* AJAX
* Bootstrap


## Credits
This was the most difficult assignment thus far and I needed more support so I hired a private tutor. I was so lost especially when it came to calling API's, local storage, how to style everything and make it show up in the DOM. I tnhought using bootstrap would be helpful and easier but it actually proved to be just as complicated as using regular css in some ways. It is more limited in terms of colors and sizing.

I am thankful for the few people who I am able to reach out to and are able to help me whenever I need them. I am also grateful that I work at a tech company because I was able to message one of the frontend engineers on my team to help with a styling issue that I could not figure out. As always, my TA's and instructor are the best!
